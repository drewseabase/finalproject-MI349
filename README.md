# Spartan Cross Country

Overview

The Spartans Cross Country Website is a custom-built, modern web project designed to represent the Michigan State Spartans Cross Country program through clean design, strong visuals, and intuitive navigation. The site focuses on showcasing athletes, race history, and team culture while maintaining fast performance and accessibility.

This project was built as both a functional team website and a portfolio piece demonstrating front-end development, UI structure, and real-world project organization.


## Why this Project Exists

Most collegiate athletic team websites are either outdated, overly templated, or difficult to navigate. As both a student developer and a Division I athlete, I wanted to build something that actually reflects how teams experience and present themselves today.

This project exists to:

Practice building a realistic, content-driven website from scratch

Design with actual users in mind (athletes, recruits, fans, alumni)

Demonstrate clean front-end architecture, component structure, and deployment

Show how design, performance, and storytelling intersect in a production-style project

Rather than a generic demo, this site mirrors the type of work required in professional web development: organizing assets, structuring components, solving deployment issues, and iterating on layout and UX.
## Features

* Team roster with athlete profiles
* Race Schedule and Meet results
* Photo galleries from meets and events

* Responsive design for desktop and mobile
* Clean, accessible layout focused on readability
## Tech Stack

* FrontEnd: React(Vite)
* Styling: CSS / Modern layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid)
* Routing: React Router
* Hosting: Netlify
* Assets: Optimized images served from /public
## What I Learned

How to structure a component-based React application around real content rather than placeholders

The importance of asset organization and pathing, especially when deploying static images

How small layout decisions impact readability, accessibility, and user flow

How to debug and resolve common front-end issues involving routing, imports, and builds

How to iterate on a project based on actual user perspective, not just technical correctness

This project reinforced how front-end development is as much about clarity and intent as it is about code.
## Design and Development Principles

Clean, readable UI over unnecessary complexity

Component reusability and scalability

Performance-conscious design decisions

Realistic project scope and iteration
