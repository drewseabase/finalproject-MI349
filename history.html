                    From muddy fall afternoons on campus loops to crisp November finishes at championship courses,
                    Spartan cross country has been defined by toughness, tradition, and a commitment to the pack. Every era looks different,
                    but the standard remains the same: race for something bigger than yourself

                        Spartan Cross Country has never been built around shortcuts. The program's DNA is simple: show up every day,

                        same starting lines, passing down expectations as much as workouts. New faces arrive every year, but the standard
